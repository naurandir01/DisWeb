:exclamation: The project is still in progress :exclamation:

# Capacity
- Display the file systeme of a disk;
- Use DISSECT to get forensic artefact;
- Run YARA rules on a disk;

# Disk supported
## OS
- Windows
- Linux
## Type of disk
- vmdk, dd, E01, vdi, ...
- acquire archive :exclamation: The file system exploration don't work

## Add a source to a CASE

In the directory that you have created for the case, create a sub directory with the name of the disk. Copy the disk in this directory

This is what the arbirescence must look like for a CASE

    /mnt/CASES
        |->TEST
            |-> PREV_1
                |-> prev_1.vmdk

Once the disk is copy, go to SOURCE and click on **ADD SOURCE** and then select the disk in the list.
